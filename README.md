# BananaGit
BananaGit is a GitHub GUI designed to be intuitive and easy to learn. BananaGit has built-in Git tutorials and conventional commit messages. These tutorials range from how to write/use conventional commits to branching and resolving merge conflicts. 

## Vision/Planned features
My plan for BananaGit is to make an easy-to-use, free, and open-source GitHub GUI for both experienced version control users and newcomers. Some future planned features are: branching/merge conflict resolution, stashing/popping, multi-repo support, and built-in tutorials. 

### Current Version V1.3
The current version of BananaGit features commit history, pushing/pulling, and staging/committing with a built-in conventional commit drop-down.
