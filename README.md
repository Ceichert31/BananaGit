# BananaGit
BananaGit is a GitHub GUI designed to be intuitive and easy to learn. BananaGit has built-in Git tutorials and conventional commit messages. These tutorials range from how to write/use conventional commits to branching and resolving merge conflicts. 

## Vision/Planned features
My plan for BananaGit is to make an easy-to-use, free, and open-source GitHub GUI for both experienced version control users and newcomers. Some future planned features are: branching/merge conflict resolution, stashing/popping, multi-repo support, and built-in tutorials. 

### Current Version V1.2.0
Big news for the BananaGit community! We now have branching! The UI for it is still temporary, but it is functionally there. Additionally, the latest version also adds a new Git tutorial menu with two tutorials.

#### Notes
Currently, the installer gets flagged as a virus. I can't afford a certificate right now to sign the installer, so it will most likely continue to flag as a virus. I pinky promise it isn't, and you'll just have to trust me. Sorry for the inconvenience.
