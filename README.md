# BananaGit
BananaGit is a GitHub GUI designed to be intuitive and easy to learn. BananaGit has built-in Git tutorials and conventional commit messages. These tutorials range from how to write/use conventional commits to branching and resolving merge conflicts. 

## Vision/Planned features
My plan for BananaGit is to make an easy-to-use, free, and open-source GitHub GUI for both experienced version control users and newcomers. Some future planned features are: branching/merge conflict resolution, stashing/popping, multi-repo support, and built-in tutorials. 

### Current Stable Version V1.2.3
BananaGit version 1.2.3 introduces a much more stable program with more polished branch and error handling. As always, if any bugs come up please make an issue for them and I'll fix them as fast as I can!
