# BananaGit
BananaGit is a GitHub GUI designed to be intuitive and easy to learn. BananaGit has built-in Git tutorials and conventional commit messages. These tutorials range from how to write/use conventional commits to branching and resolving merge conflicts. 

## Vision/Planned features
My plan for BananaGit is to make an easy-to-use, free, and open-source GitHub GUI for both experienced version control users and newcomers. Some future planned features are: branching/merge conflict resolution, stashing/popping, multi-repo support, and built-in tutorials. 

### Current Stable Version V2.0.0 🍌
BananaGit version 2 has a new look with an overhauled UI, better user feedback, and improved remote branch management.

### BananaGit Setup
I plan on overhauling the BananaGit setup process and adding the ability to log in with your GitHub account, for now you need to generate a personal access token. Instructions can be found here:
